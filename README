# Wavemod

Wavemod is a mod for Nickelodeon All Star Brawl! adding a collection of new input mechanics, aiming to increase the speed of the game even further.
Some of these are simple design or preferencial tweaks that arguably make no difference in a match, while others clearly give an advantage
with sufficient mastery. The goal is to fix what I view as problems in the movement and controls design, and make the controls more
comfortable and fluid.

## Disclaimers

- Currently in development, features and buttons are hardcoded and not configurable.
- Does not appear to work in online, needs debugging.
- Not yet acknowledged nor approved by Ludosity, though I don't think anyone will complain unless it becomes a real problem that needs to be addressed. Have fun, go crazy, I think it's all gonna turn out good in the end.
